# [`T-REX`](README.md) FAQ

**Q: When should I use a [`PAC-ID`](https://github.com/ApiniLabs/PAC-ID) or when just the [`T-REX`](https://github.com/ApiniLabs/T-REX)-format?**

**A:** In certain cases itâ€™s not entirely clear what should go into a `T-REX` and what should be a segment of the `PAC-ID` itself. For example a GS1 code containing a manufacturing date, that date would be a better fit for `T-REX` than a `PAC-ID` segment..
